`fuc`: a command line utility to Find Unicode Characters. Better unicode quality-of-life for all!

`fuc` uses a fuzzy string matching algorithm to quickly find unicode sequences from a local unicode character list. Who has time to google these things anyway? `fuc` is way faster!

Find Unicode Characters: a command line utility for unicode quality-of-life

We live in the golden age of technology. There's a computer in my refrigerator. Self driving cars are here. Why do I have to

1. Open my web browser
2. Run search for a unicode character ('h bar') to get a unicode sequence
3. Swap back to my document to type in the unicode

every time I want to write `֎` (left-facing Armenian eternity sign) or `𝋠` (Mayan numeral zero)?

I'm writing `fuc` to solve this issue, and as an experiment in learning about fuzzy string matching. If there's something I can be doing better here, please - open an issue or make a pull request.
